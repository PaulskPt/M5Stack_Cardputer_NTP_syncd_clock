# M5Stack_Cardputer_NTP_syncd_clock

This sketch shows you the current time from an NTP server on the builtin M5Stack Cardputer display.

The flag "time_only" controls if:
a) only the time or 
b) date, time, weekday and time-zone (military) will be shown.

It has the ability to show am and pm, as well as do military time or non military time.

NTP library in this folder: https://github.com/taranais/NTPClient. This library has some modifications by me.
